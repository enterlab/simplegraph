# SimpleGraph

A really Simple, rudimentary Graph (in-memory) DB implemented in Java.

Can be used as an application cache storage, and is really fast.

But mainly this is meant for people (students?) that want to find out how a graph database works, by looking at code instead of reading books.

The SimpleGraph is implemented as a TripleStore, containing tuples (well, actually triples) of Subject, Object and Predicate.
